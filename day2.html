It is the world's longest man-made structure, with a total length of over 21,196 kilometers (13,170 miles), and consists of walls, watchtowers, and fortresses. Built using materials like rammed earth, stone, bricks, and mortar, its most well-known sections were constructed during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).  </p><hr>
